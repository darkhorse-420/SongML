# SongML
 This ML model predicts the popularity of a song given its features.
 This model has been trained on Spotify Dataset of 586672 rows and 20 columns.
 After the preprocessing step, I have trained the model on KNN Regressor to predict the popularity of a song.
Testing error = 3%

The entire notebook along with explaination for the code is given in my Kaggle notebook - https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambujasenapati/song-popularity-prediction-2
