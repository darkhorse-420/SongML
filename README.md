# SpotifySongPopularityKNNRegressor
 This ML model predicts the popularity of a song given its features.
 This model has been trained on Spotify Dataset of 586672 rows and 20 columns.
 After the preprocessing step, I have trained the model on KNN Regressor to predict the popularity of a song.
Testing error = 3%

The entire code along with explaination for the code is given in my Kaggle notebook - https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambujasenapati/song-popularity-prediction-2
 
 The code for deploying this model to a website is given in app.py, although it is not optimised, and any contribution to it is welcome.
